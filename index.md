# Scientific Computing with Python

University of Chicago CAAM 37830 / STAT 37830

## Course Description

This course is an introduction to scientific computing using the Python programming language intended to prepare students for further computational work in courses, research, and industry.  Students will learn to design, implement, and test code in Python.  The course will draw examples from numerical and discrete algorithms commonly encountered in scientific computing with an emphasis on design and performance considerations.  Topics will include numerical linear algebra, optimization, graph theory, data analysis, and physical simulations.  The course will also introduce students to a variety of practical topics such as the use of remote resources, version control with git, commonly used libraries for scientific computing and data analysis, and using and contributing to open source and collaborative projects.

### Prerequisites
Multivariable calculus, Linear algebra, prior programming experience (not necessarily in Python).
