## Sample config files
You can add the following files to your `~/` directory. **Be sure to add a** `.` to the start and **modify directories as necessary**. 
* If you wish to use `vim`, [here](https://uchi-compy23.github.io/files/vimrc) is a sample `.vimrc` file. This config enables mouse control, code folding, and color support.
* If you wish to use `tmux`, [here](https://uchi-compy23.github.io/files/tmux.conf) is a sample `.tmux.conf` file. This config enables mouse control, sets the command key to `ctrl a`, and makes a few other quality of life changes.
* [Here](https://uchi-compy23.github.io/files/bashrc) is a sample `.bashrc` file. It makes some more convenient choices for managing code history and enables some color support.
* [Here](https://uchi-compy23.github.io/files/bashrc_wsl) is a sample `.bashrc` file for Windows Subsystem Linux, which also enables the use of jupyter notebooks with any browser. More details can be found [here](https://harshityadav95.medium.com/jupyter-notebook-in-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-8b46fdf0a536). In short, with this configuration, you can access an opyn juptyer server by going to `localhost:8888` in your browser.
