## Course Format

This course will meet MWF 12:40 PMâ€“1:30 PM.  Due to Covid-19, all lectures will be held remotely.  Links will be posted to Canvas.

Homework will be posted Friday, and due the following Friday.  There will be 8 or 9 homework assignments.

There will be a course-long group project.  There will be a midterm checkpoint, and a final report.  Groups will be assigned after the add/drop deadline.

## Grading

* Weekly homework (50% of final grade)
* Group midterm checkpoint (20% of final grade)
* Group final project/report (30% of final grade)

You can drop your lowest homework score (or just not do a homework) if you submit a successful pull request to improve the content of the course reader.  You can drop up to two homework grades in this way.  Please coordinate through GitHub issues.

Letter grades will be assigned using the following hard cutoffs:

A: 93% or higher<br />
A-: 90% or higher<br />
B+: 87% or higher<br />
B: 83% or higher<br />
B-: 80% or higher<br />
C+: 77% or higher<br />
C: 60% or higher<br />
D: 50% or higher<br />
F: less than 50%<br />

We reserve the right to curve the grades, but only in a fashion that would improve the grade earned by the stated rubric.

**Late Policy** late homework generally won't be accepted - please see the above note about how to drop your lowest homework scores.

## Textbook & Readings

There is no required textbook for this course. Readings will be posted in the [schedule](schedule.md).  We are also building an online course reader.

A good reference which we may follow portions of is:
[Mastering SciPy by Francisco J. Blanco-Silva.](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/11908913). This is available as a free electronic resource through the University of Chicago Library.

We will cover a variety of topics that are not adequately covered in *Mastering SciPy*, including basic Python (and some advanced topics), use of computing resources, basic numerical and algorithmic analysis, and additional libraries.

Required, recommended, and optional readings will be posted in the schedule.  **Required** means that the reading covers something that you will want to know that we may not cover in lecture, either for homework or life in general.  **Recommended** means that the reading covers something you may find interesting/useful but may also not be necessary.  **Optional** means that the reading covers material that overlaps with other sources, but perhaps you will like the exposition better.
