# Syllabus

Course number: [CAAM 37830=STAT 37830](https://stat.uchicago.edu/academics/course-info/2020-2021-courses/autumn-2020-stat-37830/)

## People
Instructor:  [Brad Nelson](https://bnels.github.io/). William H. Kruskal Instructor in the Department of Statistics. Office Hours TBD.

TA: [Richard Zhu](http://richardzhu.info/about/). PhD student in the Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics. Office Hours TBD.

## Course Format

This course will meet MWF 12:40 PMâ€“1:30 PM.  Due to Covid-19, all lectures will be held remotely.  Links will be posted to Canvas.

Homework will be posted Friday, and due the following Friday.  There will be 8 or 9 homework assignments.

There will be a course-long group project.  There will be a midterm checkpoint, and a final report.  Groups will be assigned after the add/drop deadline.

## Evaluation

* Weekly homework (50% of final grade)
* Group midterm checkpoint (20% of final grade)
* Group final project/report (30% of final grade)

10% of group work (5% of total grade) will be based on teammate evaluations.  These evaluations will be kept confidential.  If you believe your score to be unfair, you can reach out to the instruction staff.  We will look at git logs/history if we need to resolve any disputes.

You can drop your lowest homework score (or just not do a homework) if you submit a successful pull request to improve the content of the course reader.  You can drop up to two homework grades in this way.  Please coordinate through GitHub issues.

There are several things you will be evaluated on
1. Correctness - is your answer correct?  Does your code produce the correct output? (may use an autograder to check this)
2. Performance/efficiency - there are often many ways to implement an algorithm.  Some will be faster than others.  We'll let you know if we are looking for certain optimizations.
3. Style - your code should be reasonably easy to understand.  This is typically achieved through the use of docstrings and comments.  
4. Team work - we'll ask your teammates to evaluate whether you performed a fair share of the work.

### Grading Policy

Letter grades will be assigned using the following hard cutoffs:

A: 93% or higher<br />
A-: 90% or higher<br />
B+: 87% or higher<br />
B: 83% or higher<br />
B-: 80% or higher<br />
C+: 77% or higher<br />
C: 60% or higher<br />
D: 50% or higher<br />
F: less than 50%<br />

We reserve the right to curve the grades, but only in a fashion that would improve the grade earned by the stated rubric.

### Late Work Policy
Late work generally won't be accepted - please see the above note about how to drop your lowest homework scores.  Groups will be expected to come to a consensus on how to get work done on schedule.

In abnormal circumstances, please reach out to the instruction staff for accomodations.

### Collaboration Policy

You are encouraged to collaborate with others in the class and use the internet to help with solving problems.

When working with others, you can discuss problems and solutions, but **do not copy code**.  Note anyone you talked to in a comment in your code.

If you find helpful information online (e.g. on stackoverflow), put a note about what you used as well as the url in a comment in your code.  There are only so many ways to call a function, and it is perfectly acceptable to copy and paste a line or two of code (with a comment).

You are welcome to make your solutions publicly available, but **please wait until after the assignment due date.**

The group project will be judged collectively - you do not need to say who did what.

## Textbook & Readings

There is no required textbook for this course. Readings will be posted in the [schedule](schedule.md).  We are also building an online [course reader](https://caam37380.github.io/book/).

A good reference which we may follow portions of is:
[Mastering SciPy by Francisco J. Blanco-Silva.](https://catalog.lib.uchicago.edu/vufind/Record/11908913). This is available as a free electronic resource through the University of Chicago Library.

We will cover a variety of topics that are not adequately covered in *Mastering SciPy*, including basic Python (and some advanced topics), use of computing resources, basic numerical and algorithmic analysis, and additional libraries.

Required, recommended, and optional readings will be posted in the schedule.  **Required** means that the reading covers something that you will want to know that we may not cover in lecture, either for homework or life in general.  **Recommended** means that the reading covers something you may find interesting/useful but may also not be necessary.  **Optional** means that the reading covers material that overlaps with other sources, but perhaps you will like the exposition better.

## List of Topics

We'll survey a variety of topics used in scientific computing in (roughly) the following order, and with (roughly) 1 week per topic.

1. Programming in Python
2. Dense linear algebra (numpy)
3. Sparse linear algebra (scipy)
4. Functions of one variable (scipy)
5. Symbolic computing (sympy)
6. Numerical optimization (scipy)
7. Graphs (networkx)
8. Data processing (pandas)
9. Machine learning (scikit learn)

In parallel, we will cover several practical topics, including

1. Version control with git
2. Unit testing
3. Package development
4. Cluster computing
5. Parallel & GPU computing

A detailed [schedule](schedule.md) will be maintained.
